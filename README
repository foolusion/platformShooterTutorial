Platform Shoot Tutorial

This is a tutorial for 2d canvas game dev using dart.

I will try not to use any libraries because I really hate when other tutorials
do that. The goal is to build a 2d side-scrolling platform shooter. I will
break down all the steps into easily digestible pieces. Use the git-tags or
releases on github to move between steps.
